An opinionated set of rake tasks to maintain gems following semantic
versioning principles.

## Assumptions

### Git Branches and Tags

Development happens directly on `master` or by merging pull
requests. When a release is made, a stable branch called `x-y-stable`
is created. Semmy relies on Bundler's `release` task to create version
tags.

Patch level versions are released via backports to the stable
branches.

### Version Suffix

The version in the gem's version file is increased in a separate
commit right after release. The version always has an `dev` suffix
(i.e. `1.1.0.dev`), which is only removed in the last commit
preparing the release. That way it is easy to see in a project's
`Gemfile.lock` whether an unreleased version is used.

Patch level versions are expected to be released immediately after
backporting bug fixes. So there are never commits with a version
suffix on stable branches.

### Doc Tags

Pull requests introducing new features, are expected to markup new
code elements with a `@since edge` doc tag. When a release is
prepared, `edge` is replaced with the current version string. That way
pull request authors do not have to guess, which version will merge
their commits.

### Changelog

Unreleased changes are listed in a section at the top. When preparing
a release this section is closed by placing a version heading above it
and inserting a compare link. Changelog entries for patch level
versions are only committed on the stable branches since they only
backport bug fixes from master.

## Installation

Add development dependency to your gemspec:

    # your.gemspec
    s.add_development_dependency 'semmy', '~> 1.0'

Install gems:

    $ bundle

Add the tasks to your Rakefile:

    # Rakefile
    require 'semmy'

    Semmy::Tasks.install

## Usage

Semmy defines a new task to prepare a release:

    $ rake release:prepare

This task:

* Ensures the gem can be installed.
* Removes the `dev` version suffix from the version file.
* Rewrites doc tags.
* Closes the section of the new version in the changelog.
* Commits the changes.

It is expected that a `release` task exists. Normally this tasks is
provided by Bundler.

    $ rake release

Semmy registers additional actions which shall be
executed right after the release:

* Creates a stable branch.
* Bumps the version to the next minor version with `alpha` version
  suffix.
* Inserts an "Unreleased Changes" section in the changelog.

The resulting commit graph looks like:

    * (master) Bump version to 1.3.0.dev
    * (v1.2.0, 1-2-stable) Prepare 1.2.0 release
    * Some new feature

### Releasing a Patch Level Version

Assume an important bug fix has been added to `master`:

    * (master) Important bug fix
    * First new feature
    * Bump version to 1.3.0.dev
    * (v1.0.0, 1-2-stable) Prepare 1.2.0 release

check out the stable branch and cherry pick commits:

    $ git checkout 1-2-stable
    $ git cherry-pick master

Then run:

    $ rake begin_patch_level

This task:

* Bumps the version to `1.2.1` in the version file.
* Inserts an "Unreleased Changes" section in the changelog.

Add items to the new changelog section, then run:

    $ rake release:prepare

This task detects that we are currently on a stable branch and
performs the following subset of the normal prepare tasks:

* Closes the section of the new version in the changelog.
* Commits the changes

You can now run `rake release`, leaving you with the following commit
graph:

    * (master) Important bug fix
    * First new feature
    * Bump version to 1.3.0.dev
    | * (v1.2.1, 1-2-stable) Prepare 1.2.1 release
    | * Important bug fix
    |/
    * (v1.2.0) Prepare 1.2.0 release

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install
dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt
that will allow you to experiment. Run `bin/rspec` to execute the test
suite.
